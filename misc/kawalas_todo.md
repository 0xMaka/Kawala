## Current to do 

- [ ] Deque   => Give option to pop from the top of the page
- Not an issue just undecided on how I want to handle empty, if at all

- [ ] Remove  => Give option to remove an element from within the middle of the page
-  Not something I'd use over clearing, but very reasonable to expect to have the option

- [ ] Chunk32 => Give kwl32 a dedicated chunk function
- Unlikley to be utilised by Kawala
- - Kawalas implementation is more forgiving for its less performance concerned `View`.
- - Gives kwl32 viability as its own module, though Kawala will remain dependancy free.
